---

A bash script alternative to TeraCopy, which is used to replace file explorer copy operations in Wangdows. Shitcopy focuses on the file hashing and testing aspect, NOT the copy operations verification aspect. I didn't have time to put diff -qr into Shitcopy, its just for managing files and folders with testfiles.

See the [Man Page](#man-page) further down this page for details.

Why is it a bash script?
----------------
### Stability
* Leverage built-in Linux software for reliability and accuracy (md5sum, sha256sum).
### Openness
* Ability to import existing closed-source format testfiles and save them in an open format.
* Standardize formats and processes with user operation in mind.
* Avoid using specialized databases.
* Avoid storing file hash information in extended file attributes to enable compatibility across different file systems.
### Ease of use
* Avoid using Python to simplify troubleshooting and installation. 
* Append testfiles with new files without re-hashing existing files (TeraCopy can't do this!).

How Do I Use It?
-------------
Place shitcopy.sh into the directory you are working from. Run the script next to the file or folder youre hashing or verifying. Do not install it to usr/bin or use it globally. You have been warned.

SHITCOPY(1)                       User Manual                       SHITCOPY(1)

NAME
       shitcopy

SYNOPSIS
       ./shitcopy.sh [OPTION] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       Shitcopy is an open-source Linux file integrity automation script.

       Testfile Shitcopy format is as follows:
       [lowercase hash]  relativepath/filename.ext

       Shitcopy can import testfiles generated by TeraCopy.

OPTIONS
       hash    create a new testfile or append new files to an existing testfile
       verify  verifies existing testfile for individual files or folders
       import  converts TeraCopy testfiles into a Shitcopy format

EXAMPLES
       Single file hashing (file.md5 or file.sha256 is created in the same directory):
       # ./shitcopy.sh hash file.ext

       Folder hashing (folder.md5 or folder.sha256 is created inside the hashed directory):
       # ./shitcopy.sh hash folder/
       
       Single file verification (file.md5 or file.sha256 and file.ext must be in the same directory):
       # ./shitcopy.sh verify file.md5

       Folder verification (folder.md5 or folder.sha256 must be inside the folder/ directory):
       # ./shitcopy.sh verify folder/

       Importing testfiles of another format (original is renamed to folder.md5.backup):
       # ./shitcopy.sh import folder.md5

COMPATIBILITY
       Shitcopy is one-way compatible with testfiles generated by TeraCopy. Imports and converts TeraCopy testfiles into shitcopy format.
